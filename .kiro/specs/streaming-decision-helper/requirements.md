# Requirements Document

## Introduction

**App Name:** MealStream (formerly QuickPick - Streaming Decision Helper)

**North Star Metric:** Time from app open to content selection (Target: <30 seconds)

**Core Hypothesis:** "People waste 10-20 minutes deciding what to watch while eating because existing solutions don't understand eating context, leading to cold food and frustration."

MealStream is designed to solve the critical problem of decision paralysis when users want to quickly find something to watch while eating. Currently, users spend 10-20 minutes browsing multiple streaming platforms (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, etc.) when their food is ready, leading to cold meals and frustration. This app provides context-aware, food-friendly content recommendations that enable users to make viewing decisions in under 30 seconds.

The core innovation lies in the "Food-Friendly" content classification system that filters content based on eating context, attention requirements, and viewing circumstances, ensuring users get appropriate recommendations without the cognitive overhead of traditional browsing.

**Success Criteria:**

- Primary: 80% of users make a selection within 30 seconds
- Secondary: 60% of users return for 3+ sessions within first week
- Tertiary: Average user session leads to actual content consumption

**Hard Constraints:**

- Netflix/Disney+ APIs are restricted - must work around this limitation
- Mobile-first experience (70% of usage expected on mobile)
- Must work across all major streaming platforms
- Cannot store or access user passwords/login credentials
- Must respect streaming platform Terms of Service
