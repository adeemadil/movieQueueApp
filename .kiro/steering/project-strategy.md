# PROJECT CODENAME: "QuickPick" (Streaming Decision Helper)

## NORTH STAR METRIC

Time from app open to content selection (Target: <30 seconds)

## CORE HYPOTHESIS

"People waste 10-20 minutes deciding what to watch while eating because existing solutions don't understand eating context, leading to cold food and frustration."

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **Primary**: 80% of users make a selection within 30 seconds
- **Secondary**: 60% of users return for 3+ sessions within first week
- **Tertiary**: Average user session leads to actual content consumption

## HARD CONSTRAINTS

- Netflix/Disney+ APIs are restricted - must work around this limitation
- Mobile-first experience (70% of usage expected on mobile)
- Must work across all major streaming platforms
- Cannot store or access user passwords/login credentials
- Must respect streaming platform Terms of Service

## SOFT CONSTRAINTS

- MVP budget: Development time equivalent to 8-10 weeks solo work
- Target launch: Within 3 months from start
- Initial user base: 50-100 beta testers (friends, family, social network)

## RISK MITIGATION PRIORITIES

1. API access limitations → Manual input + third-party APIs
2. User adoption → Focus on genuine problem solving over features
3. Technical complexity → Start simple, add complexity based on user feedback

## DECISION FRAMEWORK

When in doubt, choose the option that:

1. Reduces decision time for users
2. Requires fewer taps/interactions
3. Works better on mobile
4. Solves the "eating context" problem specifically
